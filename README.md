# Project objective

  This project aims to analyze retail sales data from a dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset) to gain actionable insights into business performance.  The primary objective is to identify key sales trends, pinpoint top-performing products, regions, and salespeople, and evaluate the effectiveness of existing marketing campaigns.  By analyzing this data, we seek to uncover areas for improvement in sales strategies, resource allocation, and marketing efforts, ultimately contributing to increased revenue and profitability.  This analysis will involve data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to extract meaningful patterns and relationships within the sales data.

# Methods
  List with methods, ex:
  - Data Cleaning: Techniques used to handle missing values (imputation or removal), correct inconsistencies, standardize formats, and remove duplicates in the dataset.
  - Data Transformation: Converting data types (e.g., date formats), creating new variables (e.g., sales growth percentage), and reshaping data for analysis.
  - Filtering: Selecting specific subsets of data based on criteria (e.g., sales in a particular region, transactions within a date range).
  - Sorting: Arranging data in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.
  - Grouping: Aggregating data based on categories (e.g., sales by product category, sales by month).
  - Aggregation: Calculating summary statistics (e.g., sum, average, count, median) for groups of data.
  - Pivot Tables: Creating summary tables to analyze data from different perspectives and identify trends.
  - Data Visualization: Creating charts and graphs (line charts, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots) to visually represent data and insights.
  - Time Series Analysis: Analyzing data collected over time to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns.
  - Correlation Analysis: Measuring the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two or more variables.
  - Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary measures (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) to describe the distribution of data.
  - Dashboard Creation: Designing and building an interactive dashboard to present key findings and allow users to explore the data.

# Technologies 
  List with used technologies, ex:
  - Python: The primary programming language used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
  - Pandas: A powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrames for efficient handling of tabular data.
  - NumPy: A Python library that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Useful for numerical computations within Pandas.   
  - Matplotlib: A Python plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. Useful for initial data exploration and creating charts before moving to Excel.
  - Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Useful for more advanced visualizations in Python.   
  - Excel: Used for creating summary tables (PivotTables), generating interactive charts, and building the final interactive dashboard.

# Project Description
  
  This project analyzes a retail sales dataset sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset).  The dataset contains transactional data for a retail business, capturing key information about each sale.  The data spans a period of [ Specify the time period if known, e.g., one year, several months ] and includes details such as transaction IDs, dates of purchase, customer IDs, customer demographics (gender and age), product categories, quantities sold, price per unit, and total amount spent per transaction.  The dataset's characteristics include a mix of data types: categorical (gender, product category), numerical (age, quantity, price per unit, total amount), and temporal (date).  The dataset offers a granular view of individual transactions, allowing for detailed analysis of sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and potential relationships between these factors.  This analysis will leverage the dataset's richness to extract actionable insights for business decision-making, including identifying top-performing products and regions, understanding customer purchasing patterns, and evaluating the effectiveness of marketing strategies (if marketing data is available).  The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to optimize sales performance and improve business outcomes.
